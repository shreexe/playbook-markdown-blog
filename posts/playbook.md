This Playbook details a set of rules and guidelines that you should follow to get started with coding.

## On Code Editors

Depending on the language that you have chosen to work with, there are a number of code editors to choose from. We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for working on your projects. You can install extensions to code assist in your projects.

Following are a few extensions we recommend for your project:
1. Git Graph
2. IntelliCode
3. Excel Viewer

## On Repositories and Version Control

Maintain a git repository of every project you work on henceforth. You will need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com) For your system to get started.
Initialize a repository in your project folder.
Add files to a local git repository for version control.

If you want to learn more about version control, you can check out this page: [Get Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git)

Apart from having a local git repository, you can leverage cloud providers like GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket to maintain your repos in the cloud. We recommend signing up for GitHub for Education and availing perks if you are a student.

Additionally, you can share collaborator access to the following GitHub ID for every GitHub project you setup.

Github ID: [TheCoffee / GauravG8](https://github.com/GauravG8)

## On Programming and Standards

Now that you have your code editor and version control sorted, you can get started on your project. Make sure to follow the naming conventions in your respective languages (CamelCase and snake_case wherever applicable).

Maintain a clean folder structure and tree grouping assets in sub-folders based on type and components in sub-folders based on module. Use self-explanatory names for your variables, functions and class names and avoid using generic expressions.

## On Documentation and Notes

Getting your code to work is the first step. The next crucial step is to maintain documentation for your code. This will help not only other developers who will work with your code, but you as well in the long run.

Add comments to explain logic and variable return types esp. in implicitly typed languages like JavaScript. You can use Google docs to maintain.

### On Errors

Every so often you will find yourself with an error in your code. Make it a habit to read and understand the error log. Look for the line number and file name mentioned in the log pointing to the source of the error.

In moments where this may not be the case, get the error message and **Google it!** Most of the time, the error you have faced has been faced by someone else, so you will find posts on it.

You can also check [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com) for posts on your query/error. Finally, you have the option to reach out to us and have a discussion for debugging.

### On Queries

You can ask your queries reg. work or task given over mail or call. If you have an issue in the code and you need us to intervene and help you out, please reach out to us and schedule the time in the calendar **(if more than 20 minutes)** in advance and confirm the availability.

Always keep us informed about the approach you have taken to solve the issue and so that we can try out other options. Make sure you have tried more than a couple of solutions before you reach out to us. This will help you to understand the error or bugs deeply by yourself.

## Maintaining the Worklog

A worklog has been shared with you as part of your internship. Tasks have been added to the **Task List** sheet for you to work on. Use that sheet to update your status and lessons learned as well as any additional tasks assigned to you.

Make sure to update daily tasks in the weekly worklog covering the time you have worked every day.

## Key Things to keep in mind

Be Curious. Question everything.  
Be ready to adapt and switch projects.  
Be Persistent.  
Learn at least one new thing everyday.  
Be a team player. Collaborate  
Go the extra mile.  

**And most importantly, Have fun.**
